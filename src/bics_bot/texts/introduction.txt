There is something you should be aware of before utilizing this server.
To view the course text channels on this server, you must either **enroll** in the course or **unenroll** from it.
The concept is extremely basic. Once you are aware of the courses you will be taking or are already taking, you can use the command '/enroll' to join the text channels for those courses.
You can use the command "/unenroll" if you want to do the opposite, say due to an error.

Note that you are always free to use any command.

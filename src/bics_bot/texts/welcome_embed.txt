In this server you will be able to find other BICS students, discuss course related material and much more!

**Getting Started**
**1.** In order to get granted the full server access, you will need to get a role which corresponds to your position in BICS. This can be the year you are in or for example if you are an erasmus/incoming student.
To get the role head to the **#starting-up** text channel and type `/intro` which is a bot command. Then fill in your **first name**, **last name** and **year**. *(In case you are an erasmus/global exchange student choose **erasmus** as the year. In case you are planning on comming to the university choose **Incoming**)*

**2.** Take a look at **#ðŸ§­nav-guide**. It contains some relevant descriptions of the currently available channels.

**3.** EnjoyðŸ™ƒ

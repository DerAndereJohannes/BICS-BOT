## Technical Requirements Before Starting
- We expect you to develop on a UNIX-based operating system. If you are on Windows, follow [this tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) on installing WSL.
- Use Python3.9 and above.

## New Contributor Guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](https://github.com/Luxembourg-Open-Source-Club/BICS-BOT/blob/main/README.md). Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:
- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## Setting Up Testing Environment
1. Create your own bot. You can follow [this tutorial](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started), where you should do everything in step 1, and stop before step 2. Below are some answers to questions you might have about the setup process.

2. Create your own server by using the [BICS Discord server template link](https://discord.new/ymnNrwxGJHNf).

### Bot Creation FAQ

#### What should the name of my testing bot be?
The name of your bot does not matter. The bot you are creating in this guide is your own, personal, testing bot. Completely disconnected from the production bot (the bot that students are using on the Discord server).

#### What priviliges should I give to my testing bot in the **Bot** section?
In the section **Priviliged Gateway Intents**, toggle all three options. When you scroll down, you will find a section called **Bot Permissions**. Check the **Administrator** box.

#### Where do I get the token for my testing bot?
Sometimes, Discord doesn't give the token at first. All you have to do is;
1. Navigate to the **Bot** page from the left sidebar.
2. Click **Reset Token**.
3. Write it down and do not lose it. DO NOT SHARE IT WITH ANYONE.
4. In case you lose it, repeat the steps above, and update your used token in the codebase.

#### What **Bot Permissions** should I choose in the **URL Generator** section?
After you choose `applications.command` and `bot` as your scopes, a new **Bot Permissions** section will be available below. Just as before, toggle the **Administrator** checkbox.

## Setting Up Development Environment

1. Clone the repo so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

2. [Create a virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments) for Python, and [activate it](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#how-venvs-work). _**If you are on Linux**_, you must first install the package `python3-venv` using your distro's package manager.

3. Install requirements via `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Create a file `.env` in the root directory, and add your test bot's token by entering this in the file: `TOKEN_BOT=<insert your token>`

## Running the Bot

Now that your testing environment is fully set and you have a local copy of the codebase, you can run your own test bot.

- `$ python3 main.py` to run your test bot. You should get feedback in the terminal, and your bot should become online on the test Discord server.

## Issues

### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with BICS-BOT, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/Luxembourg-Open-Source-Club/BICS-BOT/issues/new/choose).

### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/Luxembourg-Open-Source-Club/BICS-BOT/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. Once you spot an issue you are interested in solving, ask if you can be assigned this issue. Pay attention to issues labeled **good first issue**

### Pull Requests

When you're finished with your work for an issue, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a BICS-BOT senior member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your local branch and commit them.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
- Most importantly, do not hesitate to ask questions for extra clarification. This is a healthy learning environment where we are responsible of teaching each other :).
